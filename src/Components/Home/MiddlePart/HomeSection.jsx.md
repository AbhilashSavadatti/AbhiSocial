### Imports

The component imports the following modules and components:

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `@mui/material` | Material UI components |
| `React` | React library |
| `useEffect`, `useState` | React hooks |
| `TwitCard` | Custom component for displaying individual tweets |

| `uploadToCloudinary` | Utility function for uploading files to Cloudinary |
| `BackdropComponent` | Custom component for displaying a loading backdrop |
| `EmojiPicker` | Emoji picker library |


### Validation Schema

The `validationSchema` defines validation rules for the tweet form using Yup. 

| Field | Rule | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `content` | `Yup.string().required("Tweet text is required")` |  Ensures that the tweet text field is not empty |

### Component State

The component maintains the following state variables:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `uploadingImage` | `boolean` | Tracks whether an image is being uploaded |
| `selectedImage` | `string` | Stores the URL of the selected image |
| `selsectedVideo` | `string` | Stores the URL of the selected video |
| `openEmoji` | `boolean` | Tracks whether the emoji picker is open |

### Functions

The component uses the following functions:

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `handleSubmit` | Handles the submission of the tweet form. Dispatches the `createTweet` action with the form data, resets the form, and closes the emoji picker. |
| `handleSelectImage` | Handles the selection of an image. Uploads the selected image to Cloudinary using `uploadToCloudinary`, sets the image URL in the formik values, and updates the `selectedImage` state. |
| `handleSelectVideo` | Handles the selection of a video. Uploads the selected video to Cloudinary using `uploadToCloudinary`, sets the video URL in the formik values, and updates the `selectedVideo` state. |
| `handleOpenEmoji` | Toggles the visibility of the emoji picker. |
| `handleCloseEmoji` | Closes the emoji picker. |
| `handleEmojiClick` | Handles emoji clicks. Appends the selected emoji to the tweet text field in the formik values. |

### JSX Structure

The component's JSX structure is organized as follows:

1. **Home Section:**
   * Displays a "Home" heading.
   * Contains the tweet form and the list of tweets.

2. **Tweet Form:**
   * A form with an avatar, a text input field for the tweet content, and buttons for adding an image, video, and emoji.
   * Uses `formik` to manage form data and validation.
   * Displays the selected image or video if available.
   * Has a submit button to submit the tweet.

3. **Tweet List:**
   * Maps through the `twit.twits` array and renders a `TwitCard` component for each tweet.

4. **Backdrop:**
   * Displays a loading backdrop when `uploadingImage` is true.

### Emoji Picker

The component includes an emoji picker that is triggered by clicking on the emoji icon. The emoji picker is configured to match the current theme and provides a lazy loading mechanism for efficient rendering.

### Additional Notes

- The component uses `useSelector` to access the `twit`, `auth`, and `theme` slices from the Redux store.
- The `jwt` token is retrieved from localStorage.
- The component uses `useEffect` to fetch all tweets when the component mounts.
